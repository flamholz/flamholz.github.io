Hey. I'm Avi. I do biological research in the labs of [Dianne Newman](https://dknweb.caltech.edu/) and [Rob Phillips](https://www.rpgroup.caltech.edu/) at [Caltech](https://www.caltech.edu/). I did my Ph.D. with [David Savage](http://www.savagelab.com) at [UC Berkeley](http://www.berkeley.edu). In my work-time I'm often thinking about how physical laws and economic principles affect the behavior and organization of cells, organisms and ecosystems. 

I like thinking about other stuff too. Recent topics on my mind include: 
+ climate science & environmental analysis in various forms
+ gerrymandering (how to stop it, methods for quantifying)
+ urban & public transit planning
+ public literacy about science & basic statistical principles
+ why American college tuition is growing so quickly
+ TV shows, fiction and poems I like

Prior to moving to Berkeley, I worked in the [Milo Lab](https://www.weizmann.ac.il/plants/Milo/home) at the [Weizmann Institute for Science](https://www.weizmann.ac.il/),  [Via Transportation](http://ridewithvia.com/) and at [Google](http://www.google.com) NYC. People sometimes think I'm Israeli because of the name and Weizmann affiliation, but NYC has been home to my family for 3 generations. I sometimes do things aside from work, maybe I'll write about that someday.
