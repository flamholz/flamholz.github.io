Hey. I'm Avi. I do biological research in the [Laboratory of Environmental Microbiology](https://www.rockefeller.edu/research/198048-laboratory-of-environmental-microbiology-2/) at The Rockefeller University, where I am an Assistant Professor. I previously did post-doctoral research with [Dianne Newman](https://dknweb.caltech.edu/),  [Rob Phillips](https://www.rpgroup.caltech.edu/) and [Woody Fischer](https://web.gps.caltech.edu/~wfischer/) at [Caltech](https://www.caltech.edu/). I did my Ph.D. with [David Savage](http://www.savagelab.com) at [UC Berkeley](http://www.berkeley.edu). In my work-time I'm often thinking about how physical laws and economic principles affect the behavior and organization of cells, organisms and ecosystems. You can find my CV [here](/assets/AFlamholz_CV_Long.pdf).

Prior to moving to Berkeley, I worked in the [Milo Lab](https://www.weizmann.ac.il/plants/Milo/home) at the [Weizmann Institute for Science](https://www.weizmann.ac.il/),  [Via Transportation](http://ridewithvia.com/) and at [Google](http://www.google.com) NYC. People sometimes think I'm Israeli because of the name and Weizmann affiliation, but NYC has been home to my family for 3 generations. I also do things aside from work, maybe I'll write about that someday.
