For anyone located in or near the Bay Area and interested in photosynthesis research, next Wednesday (6/27/18) we are hosting the second (annual?) UC Berkeley Symposium on "[Photosynthesis, Carbon Fixation and the Environment](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/photosynthesis-carbon-fixation-the-environment-registration-45980404628?aff=AFEmail)." The symposium starts at 9am in Stanley Hall on UC Berkeley Campus. You can register to join us at this [link](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/photosynthesis-carbon-fixation-the-environment-registration-45980404628?aff=AFEmail). 

**Keynote**: “*Climate Policy Update: California and Beyond*”
[Louis Blumberg](https://blog.nature.org/conservancy/2016/02/05/how-california-uses-forests-and-economic-forces-to-fight-climate-change/), Director for California Climate Change at [The Nature Conservancy](https://www.nature.org/)

**Sessions**:
1. *The Evolution of Photosynthesis* - Introduced by [Patrick Shih](https://shih-lab.weebly.com/) (UC Davis/LBL)
2. *Bioengineering and Artificial Photosynthesis* - Introduced by [Matt Francis](https://www.mbfberkeley.com/) (UC Berkeley)
3. *Molecular and Ecosystem Responses to Change* - Introduced by [Arthur Grossman](https://dpb.carnegiescience.edu/labs/grossman-lab) (Stanford/Carnegie) 

**Why Symposium?** Oxygenic photosynthesis is the most important biological process in the history of Earth and the major process removing greenhouse gases from the atmosphere. We'll have three sessions exploring the evolution of photosynthesis, engineering of photosynthesis, and molecular and ecosystem responses to changing environmental conditions. All sessions will be introduced by plenary speakers and followed by talks showcasing student and postdoc research at Cal and in the Bay Area at large. 

If you already registered, you can submit a poster abstract [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSefiXJjr-6qPdCRUtZ-PwW80d4FQBVkWGu8t5sBpLQgrk0BRw/viewform). Do it!
