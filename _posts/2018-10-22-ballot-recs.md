I've spent a bunch of time in the last couple weeks learning about the ballot initiatives and candidates in front of me for the November 6th election. These are my notes on how I'm thinking of voting, though I remain (evermore) open to compelling contrary arguments. Contact me up in person if you know me or on Twitter if you don't.

Before I dig into my thoughts on people and propositions, a word of framing. I think ballot initiatives are a sometimes useful but mostly destructive tool of excessive democracy in California. I know that this is not a very popular or populist opinion, but I think history is on my side (please go read about Proposition 13 and the Gann limit for example). Also we are all busy people and mostly don't have time to fully evaluate ballot propositions ourselves. There is a reason we elect representatives to run offices that do this for us, I think. Nonetheless, we find ourselves with a crop of interesting and pretty strange initiatives in front of us and we gotta choose. My attitude is that the people who put the initiative on the ballot always want it to pass, so you should presumptively vote "no" if you reject the premise. In some cases I think the need is sufficiently compelling that I am 

## A Word on Bond Measures and CA Taxes
There are 3 proppositions on this ballot that authorize the state to sell new bonds (props 1, 3 & 4). Prop 2 authorizes the state to use funds that were generated by previous bond sales (Prop 63 in 2004) and Propositions 5-6 will affect property and gas tax revenue respectively if passed. In order to think about these measures, it's important to understand how the CA tax system works at least in rudimentarily. 

First - California is not a low tax state. Obviously. California is has the [10th highest per-capita tax revenue](https://www.taxpolicycenter.org/statistics/state-and-local-tax-revenue-capita) of any state and generates about 20% more tax revenue per resident than the average state. This is no surprise - Calfornia has a big economy and a large fraction of [America's ultra-wealthy individuals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_U.S._states_by_the_number_of_billionaires). However, due to [Proposition 13](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_Proposition_13_(1978)), [California collects very little of its revenue as property taxes](https://ballotpedia.org/California_state_budget_and_finances) even though California property is among the most valuable in the US. Prop 13 (1) capped annual increases in corporate and personal property taxes at 2%, (2) capped the total tax at 1% of the property value and (3) declared that property values are only reassessed at the time of sale. 

Prop 13 (passed in 1978) has wrought several big and durable effects on CA tax revenue. First, [local tax revenue immediately dropped](https://lao.ca.gov/reports/2016/3497/common-claims-prop13-091916.pdf) after the introduction of Prop 13 and forced municipalities to adopt other tax measures to make up the difference. These sources of funding are often regressive taxes - i.e. taxes that affect the poor more than the rich - like sales taxes. Moreover, Prop 13 causes property tax revenue to decrease in time (in real dollars) because the 2% cap on property tax increases is less than the historical inflation rate in the US (long term average of about 3%). Rather than strictly "stabilizing" property tax, Prop 13 causes older people and companies (that hold onto property) to pay taxes that *decrease over time.* This essentially requires people who are young and/or don't own property to pay more taxes to cover the difference in revenue. This is the state of affairs in California - we are a low *property tax* state on average. At the state level we make up the difference with progressive income taxes but at the local level we make up the difference with parcel taxes (taxes that are not pegged to the price of the land) and sales taxes. 

All of this to say that bond measures authorize the state to sell bonds to get money now. The bonds are a state obligation to repay the money with a fixed interest rate in the future. The *future repayment comes out of tax revenue*. So when we authorize new bonds we are often authorizing new taxes in the future. Because it is hard/impossible for California to raise property taxes right now, future revenue will likely come from sales or income tax increases. California is already a high sales tax state and high sales taxes are an unethical way of collecting tax revenue in my view because they disproportionately affect poor people. All this gives me some pause about bond measures even though I am generally in favor of well-managed state programs funded through taxation.

### Proposition 1
Homelessness and rampant poverty are, to my mind, the core moral failures of contemporary California. There is some concern about how these bonds will be repaid (above), how this money would be spent and how it would affect other forms of housing assistance. But there is now abundant and strong evidence for housing-first as a means of addressing many poverty-related ills. I am willing to overcome my general opposition to ballot propositions in favor of a strong ethical statement that the homeless should be housed - i.e. that we should live in a more giving society. 

### Proposition 2
See above - housing first is probably the most important tool we have in addressing homelessness and the mental health of homeless people. Also - CA was already spending mental health dollars on housing, but was challenged in the state courts. This proposition is a means of allowing California to finish construction on projects that have already begun. 

### Proposition 3
This proposition is designed to have wide popular appeal by attempting to address a problem dear to the hearts of Californians - water shortage. However, if you look at the list of supporters, it includes several agricultural lobbies. The sensible-sounding opposition to this proposal (e.g. from the Sierra Club) argues that this proposition shifts the costs of building and maintaining water infrastructure from the major consumers (e.g. agriculture) onto taxpayers. I tend to agree that improvements to water infrastructure should by the companies who use the bulk of the water (no individuals use a sizable fraction of CA water). 

### Proposition 4
Children's hospitals are the de facto source of health care for many Californian children. This is not a good status quo - we should have a more comprehensive healthcare system in California and in the US - but we don't. 

### Proposition 5
### Proposition 6
### Proposition 7
### Proposition 8
### Proposition 10
### Proposition 11
### Proposition 12




In this era of rampant falsehood, when the lesser forces in our culture ask us to hold divisive opinions and critique everything, Jonathan Gold offered doses of antidote one taco at a time. Maybe mourning the good ones will help us refocus? If you feel similary, do read this lovely obit in the [LA times](http://www.latimes.com/local/obituaries/la-fo-jonathan-gold-obit-20180721-story.html) and watch this great biopic documentary called "[City of Gold](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2614776/)." It's not on Netflix, but there are other ways.
