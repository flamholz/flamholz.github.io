While I was developing my [*E. coli* reconstitution of a bacterial CO<sub>2</sub> concentrating mechanism](https://elifesciences.org/articles/59882) (CCM), I tested my rubisco-dependent *E. coli* strains in a variety of CO<sub>2</sub> levels. As a reminder, CO<sub>2</sub> is the rubisco carboxylation substrate. Normally we consider atmosphere (0.04% CO<sub>2</sub>) to be "low" and 5-10% CO<sub>2</sub> to be "high," but I wanted to try intermediate levels to understand what was going on. I noticed that several control strains had odd growth phenotypes in ≈1% CO<sub>2</sub> atmosphere. In particular, strains that expressed bicarbonate (HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>) transporters *but no other CCM components* grew better at 1% CO<sub>2</sub> than controls expressing only rubisco. This was super confusing because the rubisco substrate is clearly CO<sub>2</sub> and not HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>. Working to understand this phenotype sent me and Eli on a multi-year adventure that introduced us to the Earth sciences and segued into my postdoc at Caltech via collaborating with [Woody](https://www.gps.caltech.edu/people/woodward-fischer).

Our new paper - [Trajectories for the evolution of bacterial CO2-concentrating mechanisms](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2210539119) - aims to understand how CCMs evolved. Why is that even a question? Well, because CCMs are composed of multiple interoperating protein complexes, each of which is made of many protein subunits, and mutants lacking any core CCM gene are *dead*. That is, they totally fail to grow in today's atmosphere (0.04% CO<sub>2</sub>). If any individual mutant is lethal, how could the CCM have evolved? Like the eye, it's possible that ancestral CCMs had a slightly different function than modern forms. Just as ancient eyes sensed light rather than resolving images, ancient CCMs might have performed alternate roles. This hypothesis is bolstered by some evidence from Earth sciences, where several approaches to estimating the CO<sub>2</sub> content of Earth's ancient atmopshere indicate that historical CO<sub>2</sub> levels were much greater 1-3 billion years ago than they are today. So perhaps ancient CCMs just had a simpler task? 

To address this hypothesis - that the history of atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> can explain CCM evolution - Eli and I used the tools of synthetic biology. Using our *E. coli* CCM reconstitution we designed modern-day bacteria engineered to resemble potential CCM ancestors. We did this by removing some crucial functions, including breaking structures, enzymes and transporters in targetted ways. We then grew these "putative ancestral analogs" in a variety of CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations to simulate Earth's historical atmosphere. 

Surprisingly, we found at least two "fitness-positive" paths for the "CO<sub>2</sub>-catalyzed" evolution of bacterial CCMs. That is, two trajectories of gene acquisition that lead to improved growth in relatively-lower CO<sub>2</sub> at each step. Even more surprising, neither of these pathways involved the early acquisition of a carboxysome - a 200+ megadalton protein structure that is the hallmark of bacterial CCMs. Rather, both pathways involved early acquisition of HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> transporters and/or carbonic anhydrase enzymes. It took us quite a while, and a fair bit of math, to understand what was going on. In short - all organisms need HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>. So carbon-fixing bacteria need *both* CO<sub>2</sub> and HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>. HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> forms spontaneously from CO<sub>2</sub> and water, but not very quickly. So CCM components that provide HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> can improve growth as environmental CO<sub>2</sub> levels decrease over geologic timescales. 

Which brings me to Reviewer #2. After the paper was accepted, this unknown scientist commented that our paper "set up straw men" only to knock them down. I truly had not intended to denigrate viewpoints we previously held by calling them “naïve,” but rather intended to walk readers
through an intellectual progression that we underwent during in this project. You never know how your work is going to be received until someone else reads it, so, dearest Reviewer #2, thanks for your help. The paper is better for it.
