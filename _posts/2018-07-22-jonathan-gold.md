I find myself surprisingly saddened that Jonathan Gold is no longer with us. He died yesterday (Saturday night) of pancreatic cancer. He was 57. Maybe it's the ineffable similarities to my father - a quiet subtle-minded lover of cars and odd foods - that are grabbing at my heart now. Dad died of pancreatic cancer 2 years at 67. It seems to me like these disesase lurk in the background of our lives - cancer and depression - purposefully snatch away our best people even as bullies maraude through the front pages of our lives. I never Gold obviously, but his writing and way of being - so positive, so excitable, so certain that the intense diversity and cacophony of greater LA is the best environment for a thinking human - all that ALMOST made me want to live in LA as a native and 3rd generation New Yorker. Heresy, I know. 

In this era of rampant falsehood, when the lesser forces in our culture ask us to hold divisive opinions and critique everything, Jonathan Gold offered doses of antidote one taco at a time. Maybe mourning the good ones will help us refocus? If you feel similary, do read this lovely obit in the [LA times](http://www.latimes.com/local/obituaries/la-fo-jonathan-gold-obit-20180721-story.html) and watch this great biopic documentary called "[City of Gold](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2614776/)." It's not on Netflix, but there are other ways.
