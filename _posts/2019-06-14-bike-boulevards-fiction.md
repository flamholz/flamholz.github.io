I have opinions about bike infrastructure for sure. I wrote about the insufficiencies fo Berkeley's "bike boulevards" for Berkeleyside [here](https://www.berkeleyside.com/2019/05/28/opinion-berkeleys-bike-boulevards-are-fictions). Many thanks to Rachel Shipps, Leslie Gordon and Emeric Charles for editing and important substantive comments on the article.
