#### *Preprint* "[Revisiting tradeoffs between Rubisco kinetic parameters](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/11/14/470021)" 

![RuBisCO illustration by David Goodsell](https://cdn.rcsb.org/pdb101/motm/images/two-forms.gif){: .center-image }

All plants, algae and cyanobacteria rely on the Calvin-Benson-Bassham (CBB) cycle for growth. Rubisco is the central enzyme of the CBB cycle - it does the tricky bit where CO2 gets "fixed". Not only is Rubisco responsible for the vast majority of carbon fixation on Earth, it is also one of the best-characterized enzymes. While it is often claimed that Rubisco is slow, in actuality Rubisco is a roughly average enzyme in terms of speed. In practice, however, the true speed of Rubisco carboxylation is slower than measured because it reacts non-specifically with molecular oxygen. At first blush it is surprising that Rubisco is not faster or more specific given its centrality and abundance. 

It is often argued that there are tradeoffs between speed and specificity - i.e. that Rubisco can't be both fast and specific at the same time and so nature must choose one or the other. Various correlations between Rubisco’s kinetic parameters are taken to support this argument since they appear to suggest that fast rubiscos are less specific and, conversely, specific rubiscos are relatively slow. But these analysis were historically based on relatively little data (Rubiscos from ≈20 organisms) because relatively little data was available. In this manuscript we re-examine correlations between Rubisco kinetic parameters with an expanded dataset including data from >200 organisms. Most correlations are substantially weaker than before and only one model appears to survive in a 10x larger dataset. In this model, increased catalytic efficiency (kcat/KM) for carboxylation requires a similar increase in catalytic efficiency for the competing oxygenation reaction. This model is supported evidenced by a strong power-law correlation between the two catalytic efficiencies. We think that these results imply that Rubisco evolution is constrained mostly by the physicochemical limits of O2/CO2 recognition, which might mean that it will be very challenging to engineer Rubisco to be "better."

This work started off as a journal club of [Tcherkez et al. PNAS 2006](http://www.pnas.org/content/103/19/7246) and [Savir et al. PNAS 2010](http://www.pnas.org/content/107/8/3475.short) that [Dave Savage](http://www.savagelab.org/) suggested I run when we visited [Ron Milo's lab](https://www.weizmann.ac.il/plants/Milo/home) in January 2018. [Noam Prywes](https://twitter.com/noamprywes?lang=en) and I scrounged together data for the JC and Uri Moran did a lot of the heavy lifting, combing the literature for as much Rubisco data as we could find.

#### "[pH determines the energetic efficiency of the cyanobacterial CO2 concentrating mechanism](http://www.pnas.org/content/113/36/E5354)" 

![Illustration of a cyanobacterium](/assets/whole_cyano_csome.png){: .center-image }

Cyanobacteria are the ancestors of all oxygenic photosynthesis on the planet and all cyanobacteria have a carboxysome-based CO2 concentrating mechanism (CCM). Many labs are interested in transplanting the cyanobacterial CCM into crop plants in order to improve their growth. Here we show that any reasonable description of the CCM must account for the enormous effect that pH has on the composition of the inorganic carbon pool both inside and outside cells. Once we account for the pH fully, we can produce a mathematical description of the CCM that is consistent with measurements of cyanobacterial physiology and biochemical intuition on multiple levels. A long-term collaboration with [Niall Mangan](http://www.niallmangan.com/) with lots of help from Rachel Hood, Ron Milo and David Savage, [PNAS](http://www.pnas.org/content/113/36/E5354) 2016. 

#### "[Glycolytic strategy as a tradeoff between energy yield and protein cost](http://www.pnas.org/content/110/24/10039)"

![EMP and ED pathways schematic](/assets/emp_ed.png){: .center-image }

Offering a possible thermodynamic explanation for why so many bacteria appear to use non-canonical glycolytic pathways, especially the Entner–Doudoroff (ED) pathway. The textbook Embden-Meyerhoff-Parnass (EMP) pathway yields 2 ATP per glucose while most non-canonical pathways yield less. Naively we'd expect that cells should switch to higher yielding pathways, but they appear not to. Lower yield pathways are more thermodynamically favorable which, we suggest, makes them more suited to carrying high flux. I was incredibly fortunate to collaborate with [Elad Noor](http://www.imsb.ethz.ch/research/sauer/people/eladnoor.html) in this work, with major contributions from Arren Bar-Even, Wolfram Liebermeister and Ron Milo, [PNAS](http://www.pnas.org/content/110/24/10039) 2013. 

Arion Stettner and Daniel Segre wrote a nice commentary on our work [here](http://www.pnas.org/content/110/24/9629.full). This paper - [Fuhrer et al. J. Bac 2005](http://jb.asm.org/content/187/5/1581.abstract) - from the [Sauer lab](http://www.imsb.ethz.ch/research/sauer.html) at ETH was a major motivation for this study and this lovely and partially confirmatory study on glycolysis in plants - [Chen et al., PNAS 2016](http://www.pnas.org/content/113/19/5441/tab-figures-data) - is worth reading.

### Commentary and Framing

#### "[The Quantified Cell](http://www.molbiolcell.org/content/25/22/3497.full)" 

![Central dogma sizes](/assets/scale_guy.png){: .center-image }

A prelude to [Cell Biology by the Numbers](http://book.bionumbers.org/) on the importance of attaching numbers to biological phenomena, for without them we are just guessing wildly. We use the example of actin-based motility to show how quantitative reasoning can be used to link diverse studies together and draw inferences about cell physiology. We would argue that all hypotheses should be quantified because the process forces you to confront what you do not know and what you cannot reasonably approximate.

#### "[A note on the kinetics of enzyme action: a decomposition that highlights thermodynamic effects](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1016/j.febslet.2013.07.028/full)" 

Pointing out that ideas from non-equilibrium thermodynamics can be used to rewrite a typical Michaelis-Menten enzymatic rate law to include a thermodynamic term expressing the displacement from equilibrium. This functional form has several advantages over the usual Michaelis-Menten framing. First, it accounts for the effect of the "[flux-force relation](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0000144)" where reactions near equilibrium require more enzyme to catalyze the same net flux because much of the enzyme is "wasted" catalyzing the reverse reaction. Second, in the usual Michaelis-Menten form, you must ensure that kinetic parameters are consistent with equilibrium constants (i.e. conform to the Haldane relation). Our strategy "cooks-in" compliance with Haldane by omitting some kinetic constants and instead determining them implicity from the equilibrium constants. Finally, measurements of equilibrium constants are much more available and broadly applicable than measurements of enzymate rate constants, which are gene-specific and often unavailable.

#### "[Rethinking glycolysis: on the biochemical logic of metabolic pathways](https://www.nature.com/articles/nchembio.971)" 

![Favorability of internal e- transfers](/assets/redox_favorability.png){: .center-image }

Explaining how central biochemical constraints limit the space of plausible glycolytic pathways. We consider how toxicitiy and permeability of metabolites as well as chemical feasibility and thermodynamic favorability of enzymatic mechanisms define a very small number of pathways for glucose metabolism (many of which are similar). A nice contribution of this work is the framing of non-oxidative (i.e. fermentative) metabolism as a process of "internal electron rearrangement" where one moiety within a molecule becomes reduced at the expense of oxidizing another. Knowing which of these transfers are favorable can help rationalize many metabolic pathway's structure. I really enjoy using these lines of reasoning in teaching. Primarily the work of [Arren Bar-Even](https://www.mpimp-golm.mpg.de/1926766/Systems-and-Synthetic-Metabolism) with some help from myself, Elad Noor and Ron Milo.
