## Public Talks & Such

+ "[Understanding the Greenhouse Effect from Classic Experiments](www.youtube.com/watch?v=s88fDQM0ycc&t=3s)" on the basic mechanism of the greenhouse effect, which we've understood for over 100 years. [Nerd Night East Bay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s88fDQM0ycc&t=3s) 5.29.2017

## Internet Resources

+ "[eQuilibrator](http://equilibrator.weizmann.ac.il/), the Biochemical Thermodynamics Calculator." An online tool for calculating thermodynamic potentials of biochemical reactions using free-text search. Development ongoing with Elad Noor.

+ "[Classic Reactions](http://equilibrator.weizmann.ac.il/static/classic_rxns/classic_reactions/index.html)" - a primer on the basics of metabolism from a thermodynamic perspective. Housed on eQuilibrator and written with help from Elad Noor, Noam Prywes, Dave Savage and Ron Milo. 

+ "[Avi's Faves](https://verse.press/playlist/avis-faves-1195790641368693502)" Poems my friend [Andrew](http://www.andrewbadr.com/) thinks I like. He is mostly right.

## Academic Writing

These are my faves. Find a full listing on [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=A7RolPoAAAAJ&hl=en)

+ "[pH determines the energetic efficiency of the cyanobacterial CO2 concentrating mechanism](http://www.pnas.org/content/113/36/E5354)" 

Cyanobacteria are the ancestors of all oxygenic photosynthesis on the planet and all cyanobacteria have a carboxysome-based CO2 concentrating mechanism (CCM). Many labs are interested in transplanting the cyanobacterial CCM into crop plants in order to improve their growth. Here we show that any reasonable description of the CCM must account for the enormous effect that pH has on the composition of the inorganic carbon pool both inside and outside cells. Once we account for the pH fully, we can produce a mathematical description of the CCM that is consistent with measurements of cyanobacterial physiology and biochemical intuition on multiple levels. With Niall Mangan, Rachel Hood, Ron Milo and David Savage, PNAS 2016. 

+ "[Glycolytic strategy as a tradeoff between energy yield and protein cost](http://www.pnas.org/content/110/24/10039)"

Offering a possible thermodynamic explanation for why so many bacteria appear to use non-canonical glycolytic pathways. The canonical pathway yields 2 ATP per glucose while most non-canonical pathways yield less. Naively we'd expect that cells should switch to higher yielding pathways, but they appear not to. Lower yield pathways are more thermodynamically favorable which, we suggest, makes them more suited to carrying high flux. With Elad Noor, Arren Bar-Even, Wolfram Liebermeister and Ron Milo, PNAS (2013). Commentary by Arion Stettner and Daniel Segre [here](http://www.pnas.org/content/110/24/9629.full).
